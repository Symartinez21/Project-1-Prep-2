<div class="flavortxt">
  <p>Hello! I’m Sophia Martinez and I am a proud Filipino-American raised and based in sunny California’s Bay Area.
My art is inspired by how video games intersect and evoke the vibrance of childhood memories. Show and tell in elementary school built the foundation of my ethos as an emerging artist. The way that video games make me feel… I wish to share that with the world through digital art.  
 My creative passion for world-building and character design flourished as I polished my skills in illustration and painting
  (See: <i> Potions </i>, 2021; <i>Filipinwho</i>, 2021). Then I began taking animation classes at De Anza college
  and worked on one of the largest projects of my educational career, Kanye Quest (Trailer), where I learned how to utilize different animation programs and challenged my skill set to visualize the extent of my creativity. <br>
  I wish to continue sharing visualizations of my dreams and learn more about creating simulations like video games with the help of the BFA program.
  My understanding of 3D design and UX/UI design exist on a surface level, but learning the basics will help me explore those areas creatively.
  Working under major social media industries is how I envision myself as a multimedia content designer once I graduate from the program. <br>
  One day I dream of introducing media that allows me to share my personal identity and encourage cultural diversity. <br>
